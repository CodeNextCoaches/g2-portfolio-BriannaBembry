			<p> Hello! My name is Brianna Bembry and I'm passionate about a number of things including technology, fiction novels, food, cats, my friends and family. Apart from coding outside of school at Google, I am currently in my school's coding club and we should be attending our first hackathon this spring! I also write for my school blog, the Chew Train, that showcases a number of NYC restaurants with an accompanying review deciding whether or not they're worth the hype. I am also dabbling a bit more into the arts this year, something that I used to be much more passionate about when I was younger; I'll be performing with my school's dance club in the spring for three nights. The little things that I enjoy are reading a good book, playing with my cat, trying new dessert recipies and catching re-runs of <em>Friends</em> on TV.
